TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock syscon/clk_wizard/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out2_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware.
